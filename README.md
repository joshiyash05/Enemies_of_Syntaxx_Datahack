## Case Study

The used car market is a significant and growing industry, with millions of used cars being sold every year. One of the biggest challenges for buyers and sellers is determining the fair market value of a used car, which can vary widely depending on a variety of factors, including make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
## Problem Statement 

This datathon  aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the price of used cars. Participants are provided with a large dataset that includes information about thousands of used cars, including make, model, year, mileage, condition, and price. The goal of the datathon is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on these and other factors.
